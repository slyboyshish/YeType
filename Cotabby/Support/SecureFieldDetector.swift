/// generate a suggestion for it (passwords, card numbers, security/verification codes, ...). Kept
/// pure and string-only so the policy is unit-testable without a live Accessibility element: the
/// resolver reads a few AX markers and hands the strings here.
///
/// Why this exists:
/// The previous inline check looked only at the role, subrole, `AXDescription`, and `AXTitle` for the
/// substrings "secure" / "password". That missed two common cases: a native `NSSecureTextField`,
/// which announces its sensitivity through the *role description* ("secure text field") rather than
/// the description; and fields labelled for other secrets (CVV, security code, one-time code) that
/// never contain the literal word "password". Suppressing in a non-sensitive field only costs a
/// missed suggestion, so the marker set deliberately errs toward caution.

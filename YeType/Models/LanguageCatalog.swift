/// Defines the languages YeType can be told the user writes in. Unlike a single "output language"
/// switch, this models the *set* of languages a user works across (e.g. a German/English
/// code-switcher) so the prompt can carry a soft hint instead of a hard override.
///
/// `commonLanguages` backs the tappable palette in `LanguageTagsEditor`; users can also add any
/// language as free text, so storage is `[String]` of language names rather than a closed enum.
/// `normalize` is the single chokepoint that keeps stored languages trimmed, de-duplicated, and
/// capped (mirroring `CustomRulesCatalog`). `promptInstruction(for:)` turns the stored set into the
/// hint the renderers inject; it deliberately never forces a language — it defers to the surrounding
/// text and only falls back to the declared languages when that text is too short to tell, which is
/// what protects mid-document code-switching while still steering cold-start completions.

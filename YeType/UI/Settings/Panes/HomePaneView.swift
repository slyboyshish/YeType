/// File overview:
/// "Home" detail pane: the welcoming landing surface of the Settings window and the first sidebar
/// row. It introduces what YeType is, replays the same inline-autocomplete and inline-emoji demos
/// shown on the final onboarding screen (`OnboardingFeatureShowcase`), and surfaces the Support
/// YeType call to action. It is the default pane on a fresh install; returning users still land on
/// their last-viewed pane.
///
/// The feature demos are inert (they never touch the real suggestion pipeline). They are passed
/// `autoplay: false` here so the looping animations stay idle on a static frame until the pointer is
/// over them, keeping this pane cheap to leave open. (Onboarding uses the default autoplay.)

/// Centralizes the chat / instruct / control-token scaffolding that base models occasionally leak
/// into their output, and the rule for removing it from a raw completion.
///
/// We ship base (non-instruct) models, but their vocabularies still contain the special tokens of
/// the chat templates they were trained alongside. When the model drifts, it can emit those tokens
/// as literal text, which must never reach the ghost text. Three shapes need different handling:
///
/// - Role-header blocks wrap a role name between two markers (`<|start_header_id|>assistant
///   <|end_header_id|>`). Removing the markers individually would leak the role word, so the whole
///   block is stripped.
/// - Opening / role markers wrap content (`<|im_start|>assistant … `), so the real continuation sits
///   adjacent to them. We remove just the marker token and keep the surrounding text.
/// - Stop / end-of-turn markers mean the model should have stopped; anything after one is a new
///   hallucinated turn. We truncate the completion at the first stop marker so that garbage never
///   leaks (and a genuine prefix before it is preserved).
///
/// These are deliberately limited to unambiguous model control tokens that a human would never type
/// into a text field expecting a completion, so removing them cannot eat legitimate prose or code.
/// `<think>…</think>` reasoning blocks are intentionally not listed here: they are handled separately
/// so the text around them survives.

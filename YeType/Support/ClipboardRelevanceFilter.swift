import Foundation

/// Decides whether the current clipboard content is relevant enough to inject into the
/// autocomplete prompt. Tracks clipboard identity via an external change count, records when
/// the clipboard last changed during this YeType session, and applies two heuristics:
/// staleness and token overlap.
///
/// Why no source-app affinity: we never observe the actual copier — only the app that is
/// frontmost when autocomplete fires, which is always the typing app. Recording the typing
/// app as the "source" granted same-app shortcuts in apps where the user merely typed,
/// bypassing the overlap guard for unrelated clipboard content.
///
/// Why a sentinel baseline: `NSPasteboard.changeCount` is a non-zero cumulative counter, so
/// initializing to `0` made every first observation look like a fresh copy event and reset
/// the staleness clock to "now" — granting up to five minutes of injection for content
/// copied hours before YeType launched. The first observation now records the baseline
/// without stamping a date, gating injection until an actual change is detected.
///
/// The filter never reads `NSPasteboard` directly — the caller passes in a plain `Int` change
/// count and the raw clipboard string, keeping this type fully testable without AppKit.
